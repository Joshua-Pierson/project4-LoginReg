## Next Steps
* I would allow users to submit questions tied to specific categories and display those questions on the category pages or on a dashboard for easy browsing.

* I would create a profile page where users can update their username, password, or other info securely.
 
* I would add a commenting or reply system so users can discuss questions and provide feedback.
